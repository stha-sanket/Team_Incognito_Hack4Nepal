    Applications are submitted at the local District Administration Office (DAO) where the applicant resides.

Verification and Background Checks for NRN citizenship

- NRN applications undergo additional verification, including background checks by Nepali authorities and sometimes by the diplomatic mission abroad to confirm the applicant’s eligibility and good character.

- Regular applicants in Nepal undergo verification primarily through the DAO and local authorities.

Uses of the Citizenship Card in Nepal

- Proof of Identity and Nationality
    The citizenship card serves as the main legal proof of being a Nepali citizen and is often required to establish identity and nationality for any official process.

- Obtaining Government Services
    It is mandatory for accessing various government services, such as applying for a passport, National Identity Card (NID), voter registration, and social security benefits.

- Banking and Financial Transactions
    The card is required to open bank accounts, apply for loans, and conduct other significant financial transactions, as it is a key document for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.

- Property Transactions
    It is necessary for buying, selling, or transferring property, as well as for land registration and related legal procedures.

- Employment and Education
    Employers may require the citizenship card for job applications, and educational institutions often ask for it during admissions or scholarship applications.

- Legal Proceedings
    The card is used as proof of identity and citizenship in courts and other legal matters.

- Travel Documentation
    It is required for acquiring a Nepali passport and other travel-related documents.

- Marriage Registration
    The citizenship card is needed for registering marriages and for legal documentation related to family matters.

- Obtaining Other Official Documents
    It is required for obtaining a PAN (Permanent Account Number), driving license, and various other certificates and permits.

- Voter Registration and Election Participation
    The card is used to register as a voter and to cast votes in elections.

Automatic Termination of Nepali Citizenship on Acquiring Foreign Citizenship

- According to Section 10 of the Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006, any Nepali citizen who acquired foreign citizenship automatically loses Nepali citizenship. This applies regardless of age or how the foreign citizenship was acquired (naturalization, registration, birth, etc.).
- Individuals must choose a single citizenship by the age of 18 if they have dual claims by birth; failure to do so results in automatic lapse of Nepali citizenship.

No Legal Recognition of Dual Citizenship

- Nepal officially does not recognize dual citizenship. Nepali citizens who acquire foreign nationality must formally renounce Nepali citizenship to maintain legal status.
- The law aims to ensure exclusive allegiance to Nepal, reflecting concerns about national loyalty and security

Impact on Non-Resident Nepalis (NRNs) and Diaspora

- NRNs, who have foreign citizenship but Nepali origin, cannot hold dual citizenship. Instead, Nepal offers a special Non-Resident Nepali (NRN) status, granting limited economic, social, and cultural rights but excluding political rights such as voting or holding office.
- This limits the political participation of the large Nepali diaspora and complicates their full reintegration or engagement in Nepal’s governance.

Factors That Might Delay the Processing Time of Your PAN Application in Nepal
Several factors can cause delays in the issuance of a PAN (Permanent Account Number) after you apply online or in person. These include:
- Incomplete or Incorrect Application:
    Missing information, errors, or discrepancies in the application form can lead to delays as the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) will require corrections or additional details before proceeding.
- Insufficient or Mismatched Documents:
    If the submitted documents (e.g., citizenship certificate, business registration, photographs) are unclear, incomplete, or do not match the application details, verification will be delayed.
- Additional Verification Requirements:
    For business PAN applications or cases where the IRD needs to conduct extra scrutiny (e.g., complex ownership structures or foreign nationals), processing can take longer due to more thorough checks.
- High Volume of Applications (Peak Seasons):
    During busy periods such as the end of the fiscal year or tax filing deadlines, the IRD experiences a surge in applications, which can extend processing times by a few days.
- Delayed Response to IRD Queries:
    If the IRD contacts you for additional information or clarification and you do not respond promptly, your application will remain pending until the required information is provided.
- Technical or System Issues:
    Occasionally, online system glitches or technical problems at the IRD can cause delays in processing or issuing PAN certificates.
- Application Method:
    In-person applications generally take longer (5-7 working days) compared to online applications (1-3 or up to 5 working days), so choosing the online route usually reduces waiting time
